#Presidential Rankings Database


About
-----

This is an unfinished application that I had been writing during the
winter of my senior year in high school. 

I programmed it in C++ with the help of the SFML 2.1 library.


Features
--------

The rankings shown in this database are from the book "Recarving Rushmore"
by Ivan Eland and are in no way mine.

The application currently includes the rankings in a list format. 
The user can hit Enter to change the order of the rankings.

The application also would've included descriptions of each president.
Currently, these descriptions are output to the console window instead of
to the application window.
